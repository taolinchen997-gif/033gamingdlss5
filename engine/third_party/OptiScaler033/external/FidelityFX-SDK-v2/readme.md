<h2>Known issues</h2>

| AMD FSR™ SDK Sample | API / Configuration | Problem Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All AMD FSR™ SDK Samples | All APIs / All Configs | Windows path length restrictions may cause compile issues. It is recommended to place the SDK close to the root of a drive or use subst or a mklink to shorten the path. |
| All AMD FSR™ SDK Samples | Vulkan / All Configs | Vulkan is currently not supported in SDK |
