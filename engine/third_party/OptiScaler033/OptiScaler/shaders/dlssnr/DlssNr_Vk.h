// The composition pass on Vulkan.
//
// Same shader as the D3D12 pass, compiled to SPIR-V from the same source: the modes, the white point,
// the proxy encode and the transfer back are all shared, and any behavioural difference between the
// two APIs would be a bug rather than a design. What differs is only how a compute dispatch is
// expressed.
//
// Three things are worth knowing before reading the implementation.
//
// Every binding is written every dispatch. The shader declares all seven resources at file scope and
// branches on gMode, so all of them are statically reachable from the entry point and Vulkan requires
// a valid descriptor for each one whether a given mode reads it or not. Slots a mode has no use for
// get a 1x1 dummy rather than a null handle.
//
// Constants are slotted rather than overwritten. A single mapped uniform buffer would be wrong here:
// encode and resolve run in the same frame with different constants, and the second write would land
// before the first dispatch had read it. The buffer holds a ring of slots and each dispatch takes the
// next, at an offset the device's own alignment rule allows.
//
// Layouts are the caller's to declare and this pass's to respect. It never guesses what state an
// image arrived in.
